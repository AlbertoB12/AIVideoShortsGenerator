# AIVideoShortsGenerator - 100 % Free

This Python script automates the creation of short AI-generated videos suitable for platforms like YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, and TikTok. It takes a desired topic as input, generates a concise script using an LLM, finds relevant stock footage, creates a voiceover, edits the video with subtitles, and uploads it to specified social media platforms (currently YouTube and X are implemented for upload).

* Generating compelling and concise video scripts based on a user-provided topic.
* Automatically sourcing relevant stock videos from Pixabay.
* Creating a natural-sounding voiceover for the script using a text-to-speech engine.
* Editing the video by merging the footage and voiceover, and adding dynamic subtitles.
* Providing functionality to automatically upload the generated video to YouTube Shorts and X.
